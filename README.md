# LGBTQ Definitions

Welcome to the LGBTQ Definitions repository! 

This is an **open-source** project created for educational purposes to help foster understanding and awareness of LGBTQ+ terms and identities. In a world where there are still many close-minded perspectives, this website aims to provide clear and accurate definitions to prevent misconceptions and incorrect associations.

## Overview

I developed this website to provide a resource for anyone seeking to understand LGBTQ+ terms better. It's important to note that supporting LGBTQ+ individuals or their rights does not necessarily mean someone is part of the LGBTQ+ community. 

Likewise, one's appearance does not dictate their sexual orientation or gender identity. This distinction is crucial for preventing wrong associations and fostering a more inclusive environment.

## Purpose 
- **Educational Resource**: To offer clear definitions and explanations of various LGBTQ+ terms.
- **Prevent Misconceptions**: To prevent people from making incorrect associations based on appearance or support for LGBTQ+ rights.
- **Guidance for Older Generations**: To provide an accessible and understandable guide for individuals from older generations who may find the newer terms overwhelming.

## Contributions & Improvements

I have provided initial information to the best of my knowledge. However, I am aware that there may be inaccuracies or outdated information. 

I welcome contributions and corrections from the community to ensure that this resource remains accurate and up-to-date.

## How to Contribute

If you have any corrections, updates, or new terms to add, please refer to the [Contributing Guide]() for instructions on how to contribute to this project.

Thank you for your interest in promoting understanding and acceptance. Together, we can make a difference!
